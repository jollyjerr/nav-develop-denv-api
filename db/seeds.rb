Are you unsure, excited, or generally challenged by how to transition and grow your React application’s codebase in a typed system? Strongly typed React can seem daunting, but it empowers developers with increased speed and confidence in making code changes. It makes code extra readable, avoids bugs, speeds up onboarding, and even spell checks for you! In this talk we’ll go over some of the techniques that you can use to avoid using `any` and build your React application with rock solid types. By implementing strongly typed React patterns we’ll take advantage of TypeScript to enhance your front end skills, improve the quality of your codebase, and build clean and maintainable apps that last. If you’re working in TypeScript but struggling with how to add types to the common React patterns you’ve grown to love, this talk is for you.", speaker_name: "Crystal Preston-Watson", speaker_url: "https://developdenver.org/profiles/672", location_id: 1)

With the increased usage of mobile devices, it’s critical for development teams to understand how to build mobile applications that don’t obstruct accessibility/usability of individuals with disabilities. Currently the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) addresses a fraction of mobile web and native application-specific issues and largely anchors them to the standards for non-mobile software and web. Putting teams in the difficult position of having to decipher and validate their mobile accessibility approach on their own. In this talk we will discuss how WCAG can be applied to mobile web and native applications, best practices and an overview into accessibility features and tools available for both android and iOS devices. After this talk you will see how mobile accessibility is governed by reason unlike bird law. This talk is for developers and testers on teams that are supporting native/hybrid apps, but will be helpful for any developer interested in building more accessible mobile applications.", speaker_name: "Crystal Preston-Watson", speaker_url: "https://developdenver.org/profiles/672", location_id: 2)

Even more than that, however, we want the audience to walk away with an appreciation for how creative the Micro Frontend space is and an understanding of how this creativity has lead to beautiful innovation that is both thought provoking and rich for further discussion. Our two person format is meant to be conversational and engaging. In addition, our slides will mainly consist of diagrams and visual content -- we have a graphic designer whom is ready to make our slides stimulating and straight forward.

Thanks to a series of twists and turns, the goals I had three and a half years ago have shifted and the path I’ve taken isn’t the one I'd anticipated. Whether it’s your goals that change or your path to achieve them, it’s important to recognize that each and every experience in our journey can be a lesson learned. That's not to say that recognizing opportunities for growth does not come without its own challenges, particularly when we let negativity cloud our objectivity — whether it be fear of the unknown, lack of interest, previous failures, misalignment with current goals, or contentment with the status quo. Further, we avoid pivoting after failure because we don’t want to be perceived as giving up, even if we’ve figured out that we want to take a different direction or we shy away from adjusting goals to anything deemed less ambitious to avoid the interpretation that we’re lazy.

This talk takes us through the top antiquated asks for web design and strategies for changing opinions and educating along the way.", speaker_name: "Liz Henderson", speaker_url: "https://developdenver.org/profiles/1110", location_id: 2)

Whether you're new to product management or just looking to build more trust among your team, this presentation will touch on actionable changes you can make in your every day work to strengthen your relationships and gain more trust. Main takeaways: Why you should use your engineers for more than just writing code; Why empathizing with your stakeholders is key; How to use data as a neutralizer in a war of opinions; When you should over communicate", speaker_name: "Christine Hettinger", speaker_url: "https://developdenver.org/profiles/1083", location_id: 4)
Event.create(name: "Prototyping in a post-MVP world", day: 2, time: "3:00 PM", description: "Everyone's talking about iterating and rapid prototyping, but before you even start, you get three different descriptions of what the thing is supposed to do, dozens of user personas appear out of the woodwork, and the list of features and requirements is a mile long. What does a prototype look like when your product has a high profile and a looming launch date? Luke is a failed hardware founder turned software developer turned product person. He'll talk through his team's current approach for building a new product at Cloud Elements, the wins, the losses, and then do a live prototype-reducing exercise.", speaker_name: "Luke Vance", speaker_url: "https://developdenver.org/profiles/536", location_id: 1)
Event.create(name: "Tales from YAGNI", day: 2, time: "3:00 PM", description: "'You Ain't Gonna Need It,' or so goes the saying. Simply put, it's the idea that you shouldn't write code you don't actually need to solve the problem at hand. This might sound great in a blog post, but what does it look like in the real world? In this talk, I will share: Real life examples of projects that definitely didn't "need it," and what that cost; Why adopting the YAGNI approach will make you a hero in your organization; How to tell the difference between accruing technical debt and making pragmatic decisions; How to write clean, maintainable code while still embracing the YAGNI mindset; If you'd like to learn how to provide quick value to your software's users while avoiding getting stuck with flimsy solutions that can't scale, this is the talk for you!", speaker_name: "David Wilson", speaker_url: "https://developdenver.org/profiles/92", location_id: 2)

Event.create(name: "What is a Graph Database?", day: 2, time: "4:00 PM", description: "While reading 'Designing Data-Intensive Applications' by Martin Kleppmann I noticed that for many of the problems they covered solutions for 3 different databases: Relational DBs, Document DBs and Graph DBs. What is a Graph DB? How is it different from the other two types of databases? What are its advantages and disadvantages? I hadn't heard much, if anything, about what a Graph DB is and decided to dive in. During the first half of the talk I'll cover what a Graph DB is, how it compares to Relational & Document DBs and how it allows us to solve difficult problems that would be next to impossible with other types of databases. During the second half I'll talk a little bit about one of the more popular Graph DB frameworks out there (neo4j) and how it's query language (Cypher) doesn't differ all too much from SQL - making it easier than most think to dive in and start experimenting. Additionally, I'll talk a little bit about all the different options someone has if they're looking to implement a Graph DB system & query language. (neo4j is definitely not the only one out there) Finally, I'll end with some resources including a neo4j tutorial that starts with setting up a neo4j instance and ends with ingesting the movie rating's API and using an algorithm to make recommendations based on a user's ratings, genre of movie, actors, etc.", speaker_name: "Kyle Misencik", speaker_url: "https://developdenver.org/profiles/862", location_id: 1)
Event.create(name: "Design for the 22nd Century", day: 2, time: "4:00 PM", description: "We are stepping into a time of unprecedented change for humanity. At the same time, the power and influence of our technology is accelerating at an exponential rate. Many of the product decisions we've made over the last century have created a growing list of negative consequences, yet we haven't changed much about our approach. To survive, thrive and make it through the next 100 years, we need to rethink the way we think about product strategy, design, and development. In this talk, we'll explore the issues and underlying practices that got us here and how we can begin to shift our mindset to build a new culture of technology. One that truly works with people, the planet and the market.", speaker_name: "Jesse Weaver", speaker_url: "https://developdenver.org/profiles/1087", location_id: 2)

Event.create(name: "Mind the Gap: Improving Diversity in Tech", day: 2, time: "4:00 PM", description: "When technology firms started publishing diversity reports five years ago, the numbers revealed what many could see just by looking around their offices: there are a lot of white guys in tech. Regardless of initiatives to have better representation in tech teams, the numbers have shifted at an agonizingly slow pace. Many hiring managers complain that, despite their best efforts, there are not enough diverse candidates applying for positions. When these candidates manage to get in the door, we don't offer them the ability to rise up. Clearly, our diversity initiatives alone aren't bridging the gaps. So, what else can we do? In this talk, we will: discuss how appropriate representation in the technology industry depends on changing our culture and educational systems; learn how to use best practices from diversity-in-tech education programs to set better, less biased standards; come away more knowledgeable of how we can collectively offer opportunities for skill development and inform systemic shifts. Together teachers, professionals, and organizations alike can affect positive change for today and tomorrow!", speaker_name: "Anna Cook", speaker_url: "https://developdenver.org/profiles/980", location_id: 4)
